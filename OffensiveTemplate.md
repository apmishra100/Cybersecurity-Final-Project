### Exposed Services
Nmap scan results for each machine reveal the below services and OS details:

```bash
$ nmap -sS -sV 192.168.1.110
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.110
Host is up (0.0019s latency).
Not shown: 995 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh         OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u4 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp  open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.10 ((Debian))
111/tcp open  rpcbind     2-4 (RPC #100000)
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
MAC Address: 00:15:5D:00:04:10 (Microsoft)
```

This scan identifies the services below as potential points of entry:
- Target 1
  - SSH on port 22. We may be able to ssh into the target machine if we are able to find correct login information.
  - The target is running an Apache server. We may be able to find an existing vulnerability related to Apache 2.4.10.


The following vulnerabilities were identified on each target:
- Target 1
  - Weak passwords
    - A user's password was found to be the same as their username. This gave initial ssh access to the machine. This is a violation of CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements.
  - Sensitive Information within Source Code
    - One of the flags were found in an HTML comment hosted on a webpage. This is a violation of CWE-615: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code Comments. 
  - Improper handling of private credentials. 
    - A wp_config.php file was found publicly accessible on the server. This contained database login information. This is a violation of CWE-260: Password in Configuration File.
  - Unsalted password hashes
    - Within the WordPress database there was a `wp_users` table. The user's passwords in this table are unsalted and very weak as they were able to be cracked via john with a simple wordlist. This is a violation CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort.
  - Improper user sudo privileges 
    - Steven had sudo privileges to `/usr/bin/python`. Due to this we were able to spawn a root shell. This is a violation of CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges.


The following is an output of nikto scan on the machine on both the whole host and the wordpress site hosted on the machine.

### Exploitation

The Red Team was able to penetrate `Target 1` and retrieve the following confidential data:
- Target 1
  - `flag1.txt`: b9bbcb33e11b80be759c4e844862482d
    - **Exploit Used - SSH Access to Webserver due to weak password**
      - First navigated to 192.168.1.110 to view Raven security website. On clicking the blog hyperlink on the homepage, I found a wordpress site located at http://192.168.1.110/wordpress/.
      - Using wpscan enumerated users and any potential vulnerabilities.
      ```

      ```
      - From this, we can see that there are 2 users that may have access to the site - `michael` and `steven`.
      - Attempted an SSH connection using the command 
      ```bash
      ssh michael@192.168.1.110
      ```
      - The password for michael's username was `michael`. This exploit was succesful because there are no sort of password complexity/MFA constraints added to the system to prevent a weak password like this.
      -After logging into the system navigate to the `/var/www` directory and ran:
      ```
      grep -RE flag .
      ```
      After allowing to run, the following output was found:

      ![Grep results](images/grep1.png "Grep results")
      
      Note you can also see that flag2 can be found this way.

  - `flag2.txt`: fc3fd58dcdad9ab23faca6e9a36e581c
    - **Exploit Used - SSH/Directory Traversal**
      - From the same `/var/www/` directory location, when I ran an ls and saw there was a flag2.txt already in the directory. Performing a `cat` on this file showed the results of the second flag.

      ![ls results](images/flag2.png "ls results")

  - `flag3.txt`: afc01ab56b50591e7dccf93122770cd2
    - **Exploit Used - Improperly Stored Credentials**
      - From the hint given in the activity, I knew there was a `wp_config.php` file located somewhere in the `/var/www/html`. The actual file was located at `/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php`.
      - Doing a cat on the `wp-config.php` file led to the following:
      
      ![cat wp_config](images/wpconfig.png "cat wp_config")
      
      - From this we can see that there is a mysql database running on the machine and we have credentials of `root/R@v3nSecurity`.
      - We can connect to the sql database as seen below and use the wordpress database
        ```
        mysql -uroot -pR@v3nSecurity
        ```
        
        ![SQL Connection](images/sql1.png "SQL Connection")
      
      - After searching through the tables in the database the `wp_posts` table had the information for both flag 3 and 4.
        
        ![Posts](images/sql3.png "SQL Posts")
      
      ```
        mysql> select * from wp_posts where post_title like '%flag%';

  - `flag4.txt`: 715dea6c055b9fe3337544932f2941ce 
      - **Exploit Used - Improper configuration of User Privileges/Unsalted Password Hashes**
      - If we ignore the fact that flag 4 was found in previous steps, from the wp_users table we can see there are password hashes stored for both michael and steven. 
        
        ![Users](images/sql2.png "SQL Users")

      - If we copy over these hashes to a separate file, we can use john to crack the password hash.
        
        ![Hashes](images/wphashes.png "Password Hashes")
      
      - I also separated out steven's hash into a separate file to make cracking with john quicker. (Note if the passwords were salted, john would not have been able to crack the password so easily)
      - After john completed the output was:<br> 
        
        ![Steven pw](images/stevenpass.png "Steven Password")
      
      - Using Steven's login information (`steven/pink84`), SSH into the machine:
        ```
        ssh steven@192.168.1.110
        ```
      - Run `sudo -l` to see what sudo access steven has
      - From the output we can see that steven can run python in escalated privileges. 
      - Use the command `sudo /usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.system("/bin/sh")'`. After running this and running `whoami` we can see we were able to escalate to root successfully. (Note it is questionable why steven has access to run python as sudo. This may have been a misconfiguration of his privileges.)
      
        ![sudo](images/sudo.png "Sudo exploit")
      
      - To find the last flag I did a `cd /` and then ran a find command `find . -name "flag*"`. `flag4` was located at `/root/flag4.txt`
      
        ![find](images/findflag4.png "find")
      
        ![flag4](images/flag4.png "flag4")
